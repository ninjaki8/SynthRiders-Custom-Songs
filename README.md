## SynthRiders - Custom Songs Downloader for Linux
This tool scans the CustomSongs folder on your Quest 3 device and downloads any missing songs from the entries in synthriderz.com/api.

### Requirements
- Quest 3 with Debug Mode Enabled
- Linux
- Android Tools
- Synthriders VR Game
- CustomSongs Folder
  
### Installation
- Install android-tools package for your linux distro, eg. **sudo pacman -S android-tools** (Arch)
- Give the file execute permissions with **chmod +x SynthMapUpdate**
- Run the file with **./SynthMapUpdate**

**Note: The first time you plugin the device to your PC you need you to accept the debug dialog through your headset in order for the adb server to detect it (this has to be done only once), after that you only plug in the usb cable and run the app.
